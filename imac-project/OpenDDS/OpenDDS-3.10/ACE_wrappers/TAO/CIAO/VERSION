This is CIAO version 1.2a_p11, released Fri Jan 13 15:33:47 UTC 2017.

This is a modified version of the TAO originally released by the
DOC group.  It contains additional fixes and optimizations.
An overview of OCI's version of ACE, TAO and CIAO is available in the
ACE_wrappers/OCIReleaseNotes.html file.  Changes made for this
patch can be found in the ACE_wrappers/TAO/CIAO/OCIChangeLog file.
Many of the the changes have been included in the current versions
of TAO released by the DOC group.

Since CIAO is open source and free of licensing fees, we do not
derive any revenue other than through our services and support
(and a little from book and CD sales).  So, unfortunately, we are
unable to provide free support.

For more details, and information on opening a support contract
please see http://www.theaceorb.com/support/index.html or contact
