@page Thread Pool Sequence Latency Test README File

	This test tries to estimate the minimum latency for the
Thread-Pool concurrency model for sequences of different data
types and sizes.  The test uses a multi-threaded client
and server.


	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful, and prints
out the performance numbers.
