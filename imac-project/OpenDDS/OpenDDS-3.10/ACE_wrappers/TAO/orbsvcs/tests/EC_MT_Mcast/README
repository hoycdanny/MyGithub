	This directory contains a regression test for a thread safety problem
	in the TAO_ECG_UDP_Receiver class.
	The code is a copy of
		$TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/examples/RtEC/MCast
	with only minor modifications.
	For further details, see the README there.

	The crash will only show up when running multiple MCast processes.
	Therefore, it is easiest use the run_test.pl script to invoke this
	test.
