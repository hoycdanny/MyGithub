The subdirectories in this directory provide a number of benchmarks
that use ACE features to determine performance of various concurrency
and communication mechanisms.

        . Synch-Benchmarks -- Implements a number of benchmarks
          that test the performance of various synchronization
          mechanisms.

        . TTCP -- Implements several variants of the TTCP benchmarking
          test for TCP and UCP using C sockets and ACE C++ wrappers.

        . UDP -- Contains UDP test, which measures UDP round-trip
          performance.

        . Misc -- Miscellaneous tests, e.g., Double-Checked Locking,
          context switching, mutexes, naming, etc.
